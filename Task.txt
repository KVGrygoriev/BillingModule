MAIN OBJECTIVE
Your main objective is to create code for simplified billing of a mobile network operator.
Before the implementation: you should estimate efforts necessary to complete the task and specify a delivery date. The efforts estimation and delivery date must be shared in advance with your recruiter or internal mobility manager.

Functional requirements
Calculating call cost, given date and time for its start and end, number called, and subscriber account information.
Following payment plan is valid:
	o Fixed connection fee of $0.33 that is added to any call cost.
	o The minute fee is charged at the beginning of each minute, so if call duration is 1:03, two minutes cost should be paid.
	o Each subscriber has 30 minutes of free talking inside his operator network, valid for 30 days since the date when last credit was added.
	o After free minutes expire, calls inside home operator network are charged $0.50 per minute.
	o When calling numbers outside of the home network, the minute cost is $0.95.
	o On weekends, first five minutes of every call are free.
Home network of the operator is defined as a set of phone numbers starting with one of the given prefixes: 050, 066, 095, and 099.

Non-functional requirements
	GUI: is NOT required.
	Platform-specific libraries: do NOT use any.
	Implementation-specific language features: do NOT use any.
	Unit Tests: created with ANY suitable Unit Tests framework (optional).

Please make your code readable and easy to configure, maintain and modify. We expect
some kind of demo application allowing testing your code with some example data, but do
not make it overly complicated.
